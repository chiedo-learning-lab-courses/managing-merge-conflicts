You did it, @{{ user.username }}! Nice job resolving the conflict. Most conflicts in your day to day experience should be pretty simple, as in that activity. You may need to discuss the resolution with your peers. If your team is working together and reviewing pull requests, resolving conflicts is easy.

### What just happened?

Resolving a conflict doesn't automatically merge the Pull Request in GitHub. Instead, it stores the resolution of the conflict in a merge commit and allows you and your team to keep working.

To resolve a conflict, GitHub performs what is known as a *reverse merge*. This means that the changes from the `main` branch were  merged into your `update-config` branch. 

With a reverse merge, only the `update-config` branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved code on your branch before you merge it into `main`. The `main` branch should be treated as production ready, bug-free code.

## Step 2: Merge the first resolved pull request

Go ahead and merge this pull request now.
