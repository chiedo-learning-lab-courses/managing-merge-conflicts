## Step 3: Resolve more complex conflicts

Just like your first conflict, this pull request is already conflicted.

This time, however, I've made it a bit more complicated.

- Instead of one conflict, you get three!
- Instead of conflicts in one file only, you get two!  
- One of your files actually has some leftover merge conflict markers. This can happen if someone forgets to remove the markers while resolving a conflict.

### :keyboard: Activity: Resolve these conflicts

{% if preferences.gitTool == 'cli' %}

1. Checkout to the `add-experience` branch and ensure it is up to date:
    ```shell
    git checkout add-experience
    git pull
    ```
1. Merge the `main` branch into the `add-experience` branch. To ensure that you're working with an up to date copy of `main`, we'll use its remote tracking branch:
    ```shell
    git merge origin/main
    ```
1. In Git's response, you'll see two files with conflicts: `_data/experience.yml` and `_data/interests.yml`.
1. Open `_data/experience.yml` in your text editor.
1. Remove the conflict markers and pick your desired content. 
1. With the merge conflicts resolved and the markers removed in the `_data/experience.yml` file, stage the file:
    ```shell
    git add _data/experience.yml
    ```
1. Open the next file in your text editor: `_data/interests.yml`.
1. Remove the conflict markers and pick your desired content. 
1.  Close the file. Stage it and commit your changes:
    ```shell
    git add _data/interests.yml
    git commit -m "merge main into add-experience"
    ```
11. Push your merged branches to GitHub:
    ```shell
    git push
    ```
