  #### Finishing the resume
 
  To update the other sections of the resume, create a new branch and edit the files found in the `_data` folder.

  For example, to modify the "Projects" section, edit the `_data/projects.yml` file. After making your changes, create a new pull request and merge your changes.

  #### Enabling GitHub Pages
 
  When you are happy with your resume, you will need to publish it with GitHub Pages. This resume is ready for GitHub Pages, you just need to turn it on. Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages when you are ready to publish your resume:

 1. Click on the [**Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings) tab.
 1. Scroll to the "GitHub Pages" section.
 1. In the "Source" drop-down, select **main branch**.
 1. Click **Save**.
 1. :construction: Warning! :construction: Make sure you don't see any [errors after you select save](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13326548/36769372-bc9b43d4-1bf8-11e8-8050-2b08cf8d146b.png). If you do, your page won't build correctly and this step will be incomplete.
 
Your GitHub Pages resumé site will be live very shortly at [the proper URL](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages).
